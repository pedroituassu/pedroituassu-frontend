# Frontend for [pedroituassu.com](https://pedroituassu.com)
This is the frontend used for the REST API for my portfolio, please check it out!
Check also the [backend repo](https://github.com/pedroituassu/pedroituassu-backend)!

## Plans for the future
- Responsive design: a better design for mobile view
- Readings feature: a place to review books, articles, papers, ect. that I read
- Deep dive on the projects: a deeper description of the projects, with specific pages for each of them
- Admin dashboard: a better way to add/modify/remove things like experiences or projects
